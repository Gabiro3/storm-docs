### Overview

In this section, we will guide you through the basic functionality of the Storm SDK:

1. **Authenticate** a user.
2. **Create a Wallet** for storing funds.
3. **Add Funds** to the wallet.
4. **Process a Payment** with a credit card.
5. **Check the Final Balance** of the wallet.

Each step is explained below with code snippets.

### 1. Authenticate the User üöÄ

The first step is to authenticate the user by providing their credentials.

```typescript
const auth = await storm.login({
  email: "demo@example.com",
  password: "SecurePass123!",
});
console.log("‚úÖ Authenticated as:", auth.user.email);
```

### 2. Create a Wallet üíº

After authentication, we can create a wallet to store funds.

```typescript
const wallet = await storm.createWallet({
  name: "Demo Wallet",
  currency: "USD",
});
console.log("‚úÖ Wallet created:", wallet.id);
```

### 4. Process a Payment üí≥

Now, let's process a payment. We will simulate a card payment by creating a payment method.

```typescript
const payment = await storm.createPayment({
  merchant_id: "demo_merchant",
  amount: 5000, // $50.00
  currency: "USD",
  payment_method: createCardPaymentMethod("4242424242424242", 12, 2025, "123"),
});

const confirmedPayment = await storm.confirmPayment(payment.id);
console.log("‚úÖ Payment processed:", confirmedPayment.status);
// You simulate a payment with a test card number.
// The payment is confirmed and processed successfully.
```

### 5. Check Wallet Balance üí∏

After the payment is processed, we can check the final wallet balance.

```typescript
const balance = await storm.getWalletBalance(wallet.id);
console.log("üí∞ Final balance:", formatCurrency(balance.balance));

// The final balance of the wallet will be displayed in the correct currency format.
```

  Proper error handling is crucial for production applications. The Storm SDK provides
  detailed error information to help you handle different scenarios.{" "}
</Note>

```typescript
import { StormError } from "@storm/payments-sdk";

try {
  const wallet = await storm.getWallet("invalid-wallet-id");
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof StormError) {
    console.error("‚ùå Storm Error:", error.message);
    console.error("Status Code:", error.statusCode);
    console.error("Error Code:", error.code);

    // Handle specific error types
    switch (error.code) {
      case "WALLET_NOT_FOUND":
        console.log("The specified wallet does not exist");
        break;
      case "INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS":
        console.log("Not enough funds for this transaction");
        break;
      default:
        console.log("An unexpected error occurred");
    }
  } else {
    console.error("‚ùå Unexpected error:", error);
  }
}
```
